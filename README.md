# HLS-Vivado-Brain-Tumor-Detection-Optimization
Optimized a brain tumor detection model, initially running it through the HLS4ML tool to achieve a latency range of 367,441 to 3,458,344 cycles. Converted the design to C and manually optimized it in Vivado, successfully reducing the latency to 1,249,664 cycles, approaching the performance of the HLS4ML-optimized model.
